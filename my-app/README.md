This is the Todo App with Weather API incremented
I have created a todo list app to be developed with the react-native framework, in which the user must be able to add, edit and delete their activities taking into account as close to the design as possible

The user must be able to:
Add items from your activities.
Mark the activity as completed.
Edit the home activity required.
Delete the activity if you wish.
Persist data.

## Techs:
React-Native
Lib Expo linear gradient
Lib react native async storageExpo
Semantic HTML5 markup
Styled-Components
Redux

- Animations

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
